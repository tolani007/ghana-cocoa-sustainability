What Ghana’s Cocoa Farmers Can Teach Silicon Valley About Sustainability: A data science investigation into cocoa yield, climate impact, and sustainable profitability.
# 🍫 Ghana Cocoa Sustainability Project

> I analyzed crop and climate data and uncovered a $20M mistake. Here’s how Ghana’s cocoa farmers beat the odds — in 3 charts.

## 📌 Goal
Use open-source climate and yield data to explore how Ghanaian cocoa farming can inspire sustainable agri-tech practices.

## 🗂️ Project Status
✅ Data collection done  
⏳ Cleaning + visualization in progress  
🚧 Cocoa profit simulator in development  
## 📦 Usage

This project uses `clean_merge.py` to prepare a merged dataset of cocoa yield, rainfall, and temperature (1961–2023) for Ghana.

### ▶️ To run the cleaning script:

Make sure you have Python and pandas installed.

```bash
pip install pandas

## 📁 Repo Structure (coming soon)
- `/data` - CSVs from FAOSTAT and World Bank  
- `/scripts` - Python cleaning + merging  
- `/notebooks` - Exploratory notebooks  
- `/streamlit_app` - Cocoa Profit Estimator

## 📈 Sneak Peek
Coming soon: Cocoa Yield vs. Rainfall (1961–2023) 📉


### 🧼 Scripts
- `clean_merge.py` — combines rainfall, temperature, and yield datasets (1961–2023)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

All exploratory work and climate-yield trends are inside [`notebooks/eda.ipynb`](notebooks/eda.ipynb).  
This includes:

- Yield growth trends
- Scatter plots of climate vs yield
- Correlation matrix with key insights
